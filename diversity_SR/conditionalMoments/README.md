### Purpose
Estimate conditional moments of a distribution with stochastic estimation and neural nets

### Data
Example low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) data (obtained from NREL's WIND Toolkit) can be found in `DataWind/`. This data does not contain conditional moments. The goal here is to create tfrecords that contain these moments. Two methods are available for the computation of the moments: stochastic estimation and neural network assisted estimation.

## Stochastic estimation (SE)
The relevant codes are found under `SE/`. The stochastic estimation procedure requires computing ensemble averages. These averages are computed by MPI-parallelization across snapshots. Since the variables are treated independently, one can run the algorithm on a subset of variables at a time (this is called a block in the code). At every run, the coefficients are appended to a file. At the moment, the MPI-parallelization is not implemented to run on multiple blocks at once. Instead, one should run a separate simulation for each block. 
For the second moment, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%28%5Cxi_%7BHR%7D%5E2%7C%5Cxi_%7BLR%7D%29) is estimated

## Neural network assisted estimation (NN)
The relevant codes are found under `NN/`. The NN assisted estimation should NOT be run with MPI-parallelization. Before using the method, one should generate appropriate tfrecords. The scripts are provided to this end.
For the second moment, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B%20%28%5Cxi_%7BHR%7D-%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%28%5Cxi_%7BHR%7D%7C%5Cxi_%7BLR%7D%29%29%5E2%7C%5Cxi_%7BLR%7D%20%5Cright%5D) is estimated. This requires first estimating the first moment and then using it for preparing the dataset of the second moment.

### Running
* Perform neural network assisted estimation with pretrained weights on the TRAINING data: `bash runNN_pretrained.sh`
* Perform neural network assisted estimation on the EXAMPLE data (for computational tractability): `bash runNN.sh`
* Perform stochastic estimation with model7 using pretrained coefficients on the TRAINING data: `bash runSE_pretrained.sh`
* Perform stochastic estimation with model 7 on the EXAMPLE data (for computational tractability): `bash runSE.sh`
